# Dog-paddle

An opinionated guide for Python consumers who are interested in learning
Python, writing code, and running scripts or applications.

## Consumers and Producers

*Brief description of two broad groups of users*

### Consumers - Creators, Makers, and Learners

Consumers focus on using Python and its ecosystem of tools and libraries.

### Producers - Code sharers and Library maintainers

Producers wish to package a project for distribution to others.

## Consumers and the User Experience

- Cognitive load
- Too many decisions and options create confusion
- "Don't make me think" design philosophy
- "Set me up for success"
- **Key focus: Installation and usage of Python and its packages**
- Packaging tool authors don't represent the typical consumer

## Producers and Packaging Tools

- Experience allows them to succeed with more tooling options
- Packaging tool authors understand the needs of producers
- **Key focus: Distribution of code and libraries**
