# Unique opportunity

A decade ago we were facing the Python 2 to 3 transition.
To support science needs, **conda** was created.
Packaging has come a long way from 10 years ago.

## Meet the Needs of Users who are Learners and Creators

Focus here first to grow Python and its ecosystem.
The solution is not one tool but one approach to simplify getting started.
Users need fewer decisions to make.

## How to reduce decisions when starting

- One tool to do it all - unlikely since we have a variety of tools each serving a different purpose or group of users
- Create a higher level abstraction that hides the decisions in a lower layer
    - No magic
    - A way to understand and introspect what has or will be done to their system
